My knowledge base for misc. linux desktop and server setups/configurations

For dekstop environments a heavy Arch bias is to be expected but a lot of stuff can be applied in many distros. Switching out pacman/paru for the appropriate package manager of your choice will have to be done of course.

For server stuff I'm mostly using Debian. See [landchad.net](https://landchad.net) for a similar project centered around mostly server stuff.

## Current state

A wrapper script still needs to be written for an easier CLI.
