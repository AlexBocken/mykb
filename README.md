My knowledge base for misc. linux desktop and server setups/configurations
This is a collaborative effort of Till Dieminger and me as our needs are similar enough to warrant a shared knowledge base.

For dekstop environments a heavy Arch bias is to be expected but a lot of stuff can be applied in many distros.
Switching out pacman/paru for the appropriate package manager of your choice will have to be done of course.

For server stuff I have been mostly using Debian. Newer additions will assume Arch Linux on your server.
This is because of Debian's ancient versions of software (python 3.7 is over 5 years old now) and the resultant overuse of docker or installing everything from source.
If I `git clone` all my software why do I even need a package manager?
To struggle with stupidly outdated versions of `python` and `nodejs`? No thanks.

Newer additions will assume Arch Linux on your server.
Most should be compatible with Debian as well though as Arch oftentimes just ships more minimalistic configs.
Assuming of course that the two distros versions are comptatible.

See [landchad.net](https://landchad.net) for a similar project centered around mostly server stuff.

## Current state

A wrapper script still needs to be written for an easier CLI.
